// THIS APPLICATION HAS THE FOLLOWING AIMS..... Although you can come up with your own aims too


/*
    Try adding additional static methods to give the Car class interesting(and possibly quirky) functionalities
    1. Adding a functionality to lower cost of the cars by a percentage amount for a sales event
    2. Calculating how well each Car would perform or do in the Dakar Rally(a racing event). YOU CAN CALCULATE THIS HOWEVER YOU WANT
    Though you may want to add more fields to your Car
    3. Calculating each Car's resale value by Year..... Same as above, you can calculate this however you want
